                    <p>Amplifying Blackness in the Borderlands builds a network of partnerships and engagements
                        clustered around formations and modes of Black and Brown (Afro-Latinx) community knowledges and
                        creativity in the borderlands. The program supports the creation of two initiatives:&nbsp;</p>
                    <h5>Borderlands Black Locals Community Film Collective</h5>
                    <p>This initiative brings together Black and Afro-Latinx students in southern Arizona who share an
                        interest in film. Local high school students, UArizona undergraduates, and Black youth, together
                        with the Dunbar Pavilion, a local African American Arts and Cultural Center, establish their
                        agendas related to film as a medium for storytelling and the amplification of Black experiences
                        in the borderlands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <h5>Black Diaspora/Digital Collective</h5>
                    <p>This initiative connects UArizona's Afro-Latinx and Black students with peers in similar
                        geopolitical contexts. Students from UArizona's Gender Women Studies, the College of Fine Arts,
                        and Africana Studies collaborate on creative, cross-cultural productions (e.g., short stories,
                        zines, spoken word, playback theater, photography, short films/videos).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Amplifying Blackness in the Borderlands elevates Black voices, which are often overlooked in the
                        borderlands but are critical to the history and contemporary understandings of 'place' (and
                        experience) in the Southwest.</p>

                <p><span><span><span>This project is a re-reading and “un airing” of the sounds, noises, songs, and
                                soundtracks embedded in Anzaldua’s Borderlands through the concept of the soundscape.
                                Through an examination of Anzaldua’s primary archival materials held at the Benson
                                Library Latin American Collection at the University of Texas and the continued support
                                of the Latinx Soundscapes Research Working Group, Dr. Alarcón will use listening and
                                sound as a methodology for interpreting and amplifying diverse cultural and border
                                social texts that are integral for understanding Chicana worlds. Beyond the method of
                                the soundscape, Dr. Alarcon argues that listening is an important decolonial feminist
                                listening practice. The portability of her concept is important for Chicanas reading
                                Anzaldúa from their own complex and contradictory borderlands. Because the geographic
                                U.S.-Mexico borderlands are overdetermined as a site of violence and death for Chicana,
                                Mexicana, and indigenous women, engaging the borderlands philosophically,
                                metaphorically, and sonically is crucial for understanding the multiple ways
                                border-dwellers navigate this liminal space in life-affirming ways. Sounding the
                                borderlands/Borderlands further activates the notion of resonance, reverberation, echo,
                                and noise as key tools for investigating our lived realities.</span></span></span></p>

                                        worlds.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>In
                                        many ways, the work Dr. Alarcón does now retains the spirit of the Chicana

                                        This early project was sparked by her desire to see and read more Chicana
                                        stories, collaborate with friends, and cultivate a lively literary community in
                                        her hometown of Los Angeles. Dr. Alarcón brings this experience into her
                                        teaching and often asks students to make their own creativity and collaboration
                                        part of their learning. As a first-generation Chicana scholar, Dr. Alarcón is

                    <p><span><span>The project examines how southern Arizona communities of faith, non-profit
                                organizations, local and county officials, as well as a wide swath of individual
                                volunteers, have responded to the rapid increase in asylum seekers crossing the
                                U.S.-Mexico border after 2014, especially since 2018. Doctors Oglesby and Nava propose a
                                collaborative project with Casa Alitas, southern Arizona’s largest migrant respite
                                center, to document the stories of this community mobilization over the past decade.
                                Oglesby and Nava will also go beyond Casa Alitas to include the experiences of other
                                shelter spaces in Tucson and along the border. They focus on the experiences of those
                                who have mobilized to provide care: How have changes along the border in the past years
                                reshaped humanitarian action, and how has this, in turn, contributed to processes of
                                community building in our region? We propose artistic and pedagogical means of
                                dissemination of this research, as well as scholarly articles and essays.</span></span>

                <p>Borderland Migrations &amp; Metaphors (BMM) is a creative inquiry that uses pláticas in combination
                    with podcasting to produce trans-disciplinary stories of the U.S.-Mexico border. Plática is an
                    anti-colonial feminista methodology that prioritizes social relationships based on trust, mutual
                    vulnerability, and reciprocity. This approach contrasts power relations that characterize the
                    traditional dichotomy of researcher-subject. BMM creates a space for co- creating knowledge through
                    conversational interviews with BorderLab fellows from 2021-2023. Fellows are invited to reflect on
                    their projects; how they are currently thinking about borderlands as an identity, location, and
                    idea; and how they have been changed by borderlands research. Interviewers and fellows co-theorize
                    as they connect everyday lived experiences with their research process. BMM conversations are
                    recorded in a studio, thematically analyzed, sound edited, and enhanced within an iterative process.
                    The result is a series of five podcast episodes. The BMM project will enrich public scholarship on
                    the U.S.-Mexico border through its collective voicing of distinct insights of BorderLab fellows, its
                    use of sound as the primary medium in which to produce knowledge, and its accessibility within and
                    beyond the academic community.</p>

                    <p>The proposed project explores the multifaceted role of language brokering in the borderlands.
                        This research seeks to illuminate the underappreciated strengths and complexities embedded
                        within the act of language brokering, particularly within the context of borderland cultural and
                        linguistic dynamics. With a foundation in interdisciplinary approaches, this study employs
                        ethnographic research methodologies, linguistic analyses, and deep community engagement to delve
                        into the lived experiences of individuals who language broker. All language is culture. By
                        centering on these experiences, the research will elevate often-overlooked linguistic skills,
                        cultural knowledge, and resilience inherent in language brokering practices. At its core, this
                        project seeks to challenge stereotypes and misconceptions surrounding language brokering,
                        positioning it not merely as a functional act but as a profound and valuable cultural practice.
                        By amplifying the narratives and voices of language brokers, the research aims to elevate their
                        unique contributions to intercultural communication and community cohesion. Findings aim to
                        facilitate a broader societal recognition and appreciation of language brokering, aiming to
                        shift perspectives from skepticism to acknowledgment and validation.</p>

                        series of public talks, workshops, and art exhibits dealing with issues of identity, community,
                        diaspora, and belonging. The events will be organized by Professor Maurice Rafael Magaña and
                        will coincide with his Mexican American Studies course Contemporary Issues: Borderlands of Race
                        and Belonging (MAS 365). Professor Magaña has published extensively on the cultural politics of

                        students, and community members via this Spring 2023 series. Students will have the opportunity
                        to learn from local and visiting artists on how to use a variety of artistic, print, and digital
                        media to document grassroots histories and archive alternative narratives to empower their
                        communities. Events will include a zine-making workshop, art exhibit, written and visual
                        storytelling workshop, and a print-making workshop.</p>
                    <p>Maurice Rafael Magaña is a sociocultural anthropologist and Associate Professor of Mexican
                        American studies at the University of Arizona. His research focuses on the cultural politics of
                        youth organizing, transnational migration, urban space, and social movements in Mexico and the
                        United States. Specifically, Dr. Magaña’s work examines how youth construct themselves as
                        political actors in relation to multiple communities across time and space. His research aims to
                        provide a transnational perspective on historic marginalization, racialization, youth political
                        culture and the role of art in activism. Dr. Magaña's first book, titled Cartographies of Youth
                        Resistance: Hip-Hop, Punk, and Urban Autonomy in Mexico was published by University of
                        California Press in 2020 and received the Anthony Leeds Prize for outstanding book by the
                        Critical Urban Anthropology Association. His work has also appeared in Ethnic &amp; Racial

                        US/Mexico border employing cutting-edge tools for data visualization and documentary strategies.
                        The project lends immediacy to a complex entanglement of physiological, sociopolitical, and
                        anthropological matters related to the ongoing HIV/AIDS crisis. Health risks travel fluidly
                        between borders. At the periphery of both countries’ economies, the region is affected by
                        systematic social and economic disparities that co-exist with institutional racism and
                        structural violence. In Arizona alone, HIV incidence among White individuals has had a 64%
                        decrease from 1988 to 2020, whereas Hispanic individuals have had a 49% increase in new
                        infections during the same period. In response to a pressing intersectional matter, the project
                        explores queer-mestiza/o-PLWH (person living with HIV) subjectivity merging lens-based and
                        computational strategies for image generation. This CFP Mellon-Fronteridades Faculty Fellowship
                        application requests funds for the installation and performance design, and for the presentation

                        theatrical exhibition, installation, and performance. His practice investigates social and
                        political subjects while exploring their relations to technology with the goal of producing
                        works that are socially relevant, critical, and poetic. These subjects include: the HIV/AIDS
                        crisis; religious African-Brazilian minorities in rural Brazil; Haitian history of revolution
                        and social calamity; and other religiously, racially, and sexually minoritized groups. His
                        approaches include performative situations, material encounters with digitality, resignification
                        of archival imagery, and critical engagement with subjects, contexts, and spaces. Serafim's
                        practice brings awareness to material and social implications of media while praising sensorial

                    <p>Botiquín Fronterizo is an interdisciplinary mapping project aimed to document the availability
                        and nature of botanical, pharmaceutical, spiritual, and other materials utilized by Mexicans in
                        lay healing practices on both sides of the US-Mexico border. The project seeks to expand
                        scholarship on the prevalence and significance of Mexican Traditional Medicine (MTM) along the
                        borderlands by producing a culturally and historically grounded visual portrayal of the
                        diversity of venues Mexicans access for their healing supplies.</p>
                    <p>The Botiquín Fronterizo project will be conducted collaboratively by a binational research team
                        representing researchers from the border states of Arizona and Sonora. The mapping of available
                        materials will include commercial sites, as well as outdoor locales such as public lands and
                        community gardens available in Ambos Nogales. This project will position the research team to
                        extend the prototype produced here to cover the length of the entire US-Mexican border.
                        Subsequent research will incorporate documenting household practices, community narratives, and
                        knowledge sharing to elevate the lived experiences of borderlands communities and the ways lay
                        healing relates to sense of place, cultural identity, and health in the borderlands.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <span>Rebecca Crocker is a medical anthropologist&nbsp;who takes a multi-disciplinary and
                            community-centered approach to investigating the intersection of migration and health
                            amongst Mexican immigrants (PhD. Anthropology, UA, 2016; MA Latin American Studies, Stanford
                            University, 1999; BA History, Stanford University, 1994). Her work as part of team science
                            studies in the University of Arizona College of Public Health focuses on contextual factors
                            that influence the heavy burden of chronic disease and related complications affecting
                            Mexican communities in the US Southwest, community levels sources of stress and resilience,
                            the emotional experience of migration, traditional healing modalities, and binational
                            barriers to medical care access. Her work has been widely published in academic journals of
                            anthropology, public health, and ethnohistory, as well as applied reports designed to meet
                            the needs of local service organizations and Tucson city efforts. Her doctoral studies at
                            the University of Arizona used anthropology as a lens to explore the how emotional suffering
                            related to migration was perceived by migrants to impact their health. This work was among
                            the first to argue that emotional distress be considered as an important causal factor in
                            immigrant health declines post migration, which was subsequently cited in the Washington
                            Post. Prior to returning to graduate school,&nbsp;Rebecca worked in and researched among
                            Latin American immigrant communities in California, Arizona, and North Carolina for over a
                            decade, serving as a public-school teacher, violence prevention organizer, and certified
                            language interpreter.</span></p>

                <p><strong>Forensic Citizenship in the Borderlands</strong>&nbsp;is a visual and oral history project
                    that will document, analyze, and share the stories of civilian forensic expertise on both sides of
                    the Arizona-Sonora border. Working closely with the UA libraries and two community organizations,
                    Madres Buscadoras and the Colibrí Center for Human Rights, this project will create an interactive
                    website to highlight this work and explore forensics in the landscape of the borderlands. The site
                    will feature three components: interviews with citizen-forensic experts, videography of the
                    landscape in which they work, and a bi-national map displaying the GPS locations where they have
                    found or identified human remains. This project will broaden the national and international
                    understanding of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands by presenting a fully bi-national view of border
                    related violence, and by making visible the leadership, expertise, and action on the part of those
                    impacted. The story this project will tell is one about regular people in the borderlands who step
                    up to do extraordinary work; who not only make visible violence occurring in the borderlands but
                    also challenge the authority of the state by becoming forensic experts.</p>

                            Communities</strong>&nbsp;comprises a new interdisciplinary course offering that unites
                        students and faculty from four different universities located along the U.S.-Mexico border: CETY
                        Universidad, Universidad de Sonora, Eastern New Mexico University, and the University of
                        Arizona. The project consists of developing a 15-week bi-national online course in which
                        cultural, economic, and social convergences that occur in border communities will be
                        explored.&nbsp; During the shared course, professors from each university will take turns
                        teaching a 3-week thematic unit from their area of academic expertise (e.g. international
                        economics, intercultural communication, history, immigration).&nbsp; Each unit will require
                        students to work with their international peers via weekly discussion forums, live chats, and
                        collaborative video projects. At the end of the course, students will develop a virtual capstone
                        project with a classmate from the other side of the international border and represent
                        perspectives from both the United States and Mexico. The capstone projects will be published on
                        a public website specifically created for this bi-national project. The four universities
                        involved have committed to offering this collaborative course for at least three years.</p>

                <p><span>Flooding is a critical threat in the US-Mexico borderlands perpetuated by a lack of high
                        quality, granular flood data. To challenge this flood injustice, Belury have co-conceived a
                        participatory dissertation project that leverages satellite imagery and collaboration with
                        community-based, flood justice advocacy organizations. This project focuses on two regions of
                        the US-Mexico border: Nogales, Sonora/Nogales, Arizona (Ambos Nogales), and the Rio Grande/Rio
                        Bravo Delta of the Texas-Tamaulipas border. The digital humanities can improve the impact of
                        this project, transcend the disciplinary boundaries of flood mapping, and further engage local
                        stakeholders and the public. With the 2023 Mellon-Fronteridades Graduate Fellowship Belury will
                        produce and host the podcast Flood Justice in the Borderlands. This bilingual podcast will be
                        conducted in English, then repeated in Spanish, thus communicating this information to bilingual
                        audiences. Belury will host and produce one podcast on Ambos Nogales (English/Spanish) and one
                        podcast in the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Delta (English/Spanish), totaling four podcast episodes. In
                        addition, Belury will develop a website to host the podcast series and the satellite flooding
                        imagery Belury is generating. The website and accompanying satellite imagery will increase the
                        communication of this project to the public and enhance the podcast experience by enabling
                        listeners to visualize the scope and impact of these flood events. This bilingual podcast is
                        also an opportunity to interview flood justice experts in the borderlands and share their
                        knowledge with a broad and diverse audience.</span></p>

                            owners along Morley Avenue in Nogales, Arizona, a street known historically (1950s-1990s)
                            for its commercial district catering to Mexican commercial clientele. Choi is interested in
                            how this business district emerged, particularly in relation to Jewish and Asian American
                            entrepreneurs. At the same time, Choi's oral histories will also explore how this vibrant
                            commercial and cultural space was impacted by increased border militarization of the 1990s
                            and beyond, in addition to the near closure of the border during the COVID pandemic. Choi
                            sees Morley Avenue as a site of placemaking and cross-border flows, drawing from Choi's
                            personal history with her own family’s shop along the border. This project moves beyond
                            Choi's autoethnographic work to include oral histories from business-owning families along
                            the street to gain a deeper and broader understanding of place making and belonging along
                            the Arizona Borderlands.</span></p>

                    <p><span>Cordova's project, Ghosts and Shadows, is a 20-minute audio/video artwork that aims to
                            uncover a common auditory and visual language between humans and the US/Mexico Border as
                            immaterial/material-entity. Cordova will use this uncovering of language to interpret the
                            agency of its material properties. Cordova wonders, what else does the material of the
                            border wall desire to become instead of its current desecrated, masculine and phallocentric
                            form? As a part of this project, Cordova will employ resistance strategies integral to the
                            counter-narratives of his family’s own oral histories. The oral history central to this
                            endeavor is that of Cordova's uncle, who was a long-time labor activist and organizer
                            beginning with the United Farm Workers in the 1960s and 70s. The interdisciplinary
                            performance methodologies Cordova will employ to commune with the US/Mexico Border will
                            evade rational understanding operating at sensorial and emotional registers. Cordova will
                            screen the final 20-minute audio/video artwork locally in Tucson in a university setting.
                            The screening will be followed by a community engagement discussion with group reflections.
                            Discussion questions will be framed and guided by guest scholars from the university
                            community. Additionally, Cordova will make the work and myself available for classes and
                            symposiums.</span></p>

                    <p><span>There is an abundance of literature on foodways at the U.S-Mexican border, yet there is no
                            concise documentation of Mexican convenience stores or “mercados'' in the southwest
                            borderlands. This project aims to register how mercados across the border recreate their
                            spaces, resources, and define symbolic and cultural ties to their communities. The
                            documentation of Mexican ethnic stores has considerable implications, for one; mapping out
                            access to different food systems which can culturally determine terms of quality, nutrition,
                            knowledge, and a sense of belonging to one's community. In this sense, the goal of this
                            project represents a matter of political, environmental, community health, and the
                            importance of cultural spaces, and to explore its relation to commodity consumption of
                            ethnic products. Through such documentation will be produced a website that will register
                            mercados, essentially creating a cultural mapping of such spaces along the southwest border
                            and telling their stories of how they came to be. In this context this project will point to
                            understanding how mercados construct through symbolic, material (food and resources), the
                            integration of these communities in their cultural surroundings, especially in
                            border-spaces. This project will document these crucial spaces, by interrogating, how do
                            communities in the southwest border (re)produce their cultural identities through commodity
                            consumption, and based on this, what else is being consumed beyond the foods and materials
                            sold in mercado spaces? Further exploring the relationship between Mexican identity and
                            mercados and the production's experience and knowledge at the southwest border.</span></p>

                    <p><span>Running “Raza” contextualizes the violent, alienating, complicated, and racist experience
                            of incarceration in Arizona as a phenomenon that is site specific to the Sonoran
                            Borderlands, situated at the confluence of tensions in the political discourse of
                            immigration and crime more broadly– as well as inside prison. My work brings to life the
                            experience of being a young, bilingual prisoner with a multi-ethnic identity split by a
                            transnational boundary between the U.S. and Mexico, highlighting the fraught interracial
                            dynamics of prison society, colloquially known as “prison politics.” A prime example is the
                            distinction made between Paisas, or Mexican nationals, who are categorized as a different
                            “race” than Raza, or Chicanos. This racial distinction, thrown into stark relief by the
                            tension and rivalry between Raza and Paisas in prison, is impossible to reproduce in free
                            society. Arizona’s prison culture illuminates the way that transborder ethnic identities are
                            refracted through the lens of carceral spaces. Through autoethnographic methods of
                            (re)locating memory as a deeply place-based experience, Olivares-Pelayo work examines the
                            narrative of not only my own incarceration, but the stories that frame punishment and
                            justice in the Sonoran Borderlands.</span></p>

                        there are also multiple networks in place to support them along the way. Despite extensive

                            Arizona-Sonora borderlands. Although there is growing attention drawn to Asian Americans in
                            Latin American studies, the studies specifically on language, race, and identity issues of
                            Chinese Americans in the borderlands have been relatively limited. Chinese Americans living
                            in this area have been discriminated against throughout history. Since the outbreak of the
                            COVID-19 pandemic, Sinophobia has been reignited worldwide, including in both the United
                            States and Mexico. Amid this unprecedented era, this project focuses on how K-12 Chinese
                            American students construct and navigate their identities through their daily interactions
                            with people in the borderlands. This project provides an empirical and timely account of the
                            translingual, transcultural, and transracial experiences of the young generation of Chinese
                            Americans. This project also investigates how people of other races perceive and position
                            these young Chinese Americans. It is important to recognize the presence of Chinese
                            Americans in the borderlands, not only because it covers the lacuna in the U.S.-Mexico
                            border studies but also because the presence of Chinese Americans and the formation of
                            communities impacted the larger Asian and Latin American communities nationwide and in
                            Global Asia. The findings of the project will broaden the understanding of the lived
                            experience in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands by presenting the research papers published in
                            journals or conferences.</span></p>

                <p>For almost one hundred years Lucha Libre events in Mexico have played a pivotal role in shaping and
                    reinforcing Mexican identity. Within the ring, Mexican wrestlers embody intricate social constructs
                    related to class, ethnicity, gender roles, indigeneity and hybrid beliefs. Having grown up attending
                    these events, watching El Santo (one of the most renowned luchador in history) movies and the
                    various forms of media that transmitted his enormous pop culture success, I’ve witnessed how these
                    portrayals have altered my own perception of identity. Through photo, video and oral history
                    recordings I will explore the particularities of Lucha Libre events around the border region in
                    Sonora and Arizona. Focusing on the significance to the people that follow this tradition. The
                    outcome will be a portrait exhibition of Mexican people who wear their Lucha Libre mask with pride
                    at their homes, places of upbringing, workplaces and along the border. Additionally, I will record
                    the oral history of these individuals focusing on their upbringing, immigration experiences, life in
                    the border region and what attending the Lucha Libre events mean to them. Finally, I will make
                    360-degree video clips from the center of the ring that immerse the viewer in the Lucha Libre
                    experience and engage people on a visceral level. The final exhibition will be hosted in two arenas,
                    one in Sonora and the other in Arizona, rendering it a public event and extending access to the same
                    demographic that are the spectators of this tradition.</p>
                <p>Andrés grew up in Mexico City, where he began working in documentary films and later included
                    photography in his practice. There, Andrés began an examination of Mexican identity through Lucha
                    Libre events. He has been working on this subject for around 2 years, presenting a photographic
                    exhibition called “Your Insults are Welcome” inside a Mexican Wrestling arena. Andrés’ work delves
                    into the complexities and contradictions of the human experience while also exploring what identity
                    means and how it is built over the years. Sociology has been an important point of reference,
                    providing insights into how people develop specific behaviors, traits, and traditions according to
                    their own environment. Andrés received his BA in Communications and Media Studies at the Universidad
                    Iberoamericana in Mexico City. Andrés is a recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship to pursue a graduate

                    <p>In November 1989, the Berlin Wall came crashing down. Almost everybody in the world cheered
                        loudly. However, within five years of its fall, the United States started building their own
                        wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. For the past twenty-five years, a wrought-iron railing the color
                        of blood has kept rising on top of what before was just a symbolic ranch-style fence line
                        separating the two countries. In a few years, the harmless fence turned into a sinister 30-feet
                        steel wall with strings of concertina wire stretched toward the sky, covering about 800 miles of
                        the 2000-mile border. The billions of dollars spent in its construction could have supported
                        education, healthcare, or the environment instead.</p>

                        settlements in North America: the wall cuts through the tribal homelands of at least seven
                        Native American Nations in the United States, and several indigenous peoples in Mexico,
                        separating tribe members from their relatives, sacred sites, and natural environments. Every day
                        since the wall has been standing, people on both sides have been traveling to meet, talk, eat,
                        touch hands, and even kiss through the openings in the iron bars.</p>
                    <p>“Native Americans &amp; The Border Wall” wishes to be a 15-20 minutes documentary that
                        investigates the social, cultural, human, and environmental harm that the construction of the
                        physical border wall has brought to the native peoples’ lives and homelands along the entire
                        Southwest Border.</p>

                    <p>The landscape of reproductive care in Arizona lacks providers and clinics, restricts access to
                        services and care, and imposes fees that reduce reproductive autonomy, disproportionately
                        impacting communities marginalized by their race, gender, sexuality, ability, citizenship
                        status, and class. In response, birthworkers – non-medical birth companions who provide
                        informational, physical, and emotional support to people during abortions, pregnancy, birth, and
                        the postpartum period – are mobilizing to address gaps in reproductive healthcare provision. The
                        Cihuapactli Collective in Tucson, Arizona is a group of Indigenous, Black, and Latinx
                        birthworkers who offer full-spectrum reproductive care in their communities while cultivating
                        mutual support amongst each other. Increasing the collective’s visibility has urgent
                        implications; sharing knowledge creates reproductive care options and fosters community
                        belonging by offering a model of solidarity building that can expand autonomy and access for
                        marginalized communities.</p>
                    <p>With the 2024 Mellon-Fronteridades Graduate Fellowship, I will collaborate with the Cihuapactli
                        Collective to organize a visual-narrative exhibition that introduces Tucson to local
                        birthworkers through photography and personal narratives about their relationship with
                        birthwork. This project transcends disciplinary boundaries, blending art and storytelling to
                        increase birthworker visibility and public engagement. It will practically advance
                        understandings of the causes and responses to reproductive (in)justice in the U.S.-Mexico
                        borderlands by documenting how birthworkers leverage ancestral and learned knowledges to enact
                        community care. Overall, this collaborative exhibition will highlight the histories, heritages,
                        and sociopolitical environments of individuals who join a collective to alleviate gaps in
                        reproductive health care provision.</p>

                        over more than 2,500 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and
                        Texas. The project aims to make U.S. border security infrastructure—particularly the expanding
                        network of surveillance towers that stretches from remote patches of desert to small towns and
                        bustling metropolises, from residential back yards to community college campuses, and from
                        public parks and nature preserves to private ranches across the region— more visible to public

                        impacts of border policing on the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. This is accomplished through a public
                        website and a multimodal exhibition of photographs and supporting texts on the University of
                        Arizona campus in April 2024, and longer-term outcomes including a published photography book

                        movement of migrants who are displaced because of climate-related disasters. The project will
                        use multimedia components such as audio, video, and photography to humanize these issues. I will
                        also be using data and interviewing climate scientists to understand the science behind climate
                        change. Additionally, I want to highlight the various push and pull factors that climate
                        migrants are enduring and how it impacts them when they migrate to the Nogales, Sonora border.

                        of population from as far away as India crossing the Arizona-Mexico border. Is journeying to the
                        other side of the world, from ‘periphery’ to ‘core’, enough to alter their structural
                        positionality in the world-system? What is their story that convinces them to embark on such a
                        treacherous journey? Why are they leaving documents with which their identities can be
                        reconstructed along the militarized border? Understanding the answers to these questions is
                        significant because “the personal is international” and making feminist sense of this
                        international investigation is a push towards informing feminist policy and pedagogy. Between
                        borders moving over people and people moving over borders, there is a pedagogy of migration that
                        is being shaped, written, and practiced by migrants from the global south. It is a pedagogy of
                        abundant hope, agency, resistance, and social transformation, and is feminist in its
                        counterhegemonic pushback against systemic inequality. This Participatory Action Research
                        explores how migrants from the global south reshape the world as they write their own pedagogies
                        into the liminal space of the southwest borderlands. This project will deliver: 1. a digital
                        story to challenge biased narratives, 2. an article to inform feminist policy and pedagogy, and
                        3. arts-based artefacts authored by migrants, which might be put on an interactive feminist
                        exhibition. The vision is to co-create spaces of healing and agency as migrants write their own
                        humanizing feminist narratives.</p>

                <p>This ethnographic film project focuses on return-migrants living and working in the burgeoning
                    community in downtown Mexico City known as "Little LA." In recent years, 1.5 generation undocumented
                    migrants -those brought across the border as young infants and living in the U.S.- have been forced
                    to cross the border back to Mexico. This trans-border population flow represents the latest stage of
                    a neoliberal migration pattern that complicates our established understanding of the south to north
                    Mexican diaspora. Although they are "Mexican," these fully Americanized trans-border migrants are
                    accustomed to living in the U.S., and they struggle to ground their identity in the sprawling urban
                    landscape of one of the world's largest cities. This film asks the following: How do former
                    "Americans" live after deportation in a country they barely know, and how do they navigate the
                    challenges of forced return migration? How does the collective trauma of deportation lead to
                    community-building and the creation of a unified sense of belonging hundreds of miles from the U.S.
                    Mexico border?&nbsp;</p>

                        from personal narratives as well as placing them within the broader context of the historical
                        patterns of Asian immigration in this region. Building on my own personal reflections, this

                        place-making, and community formations for the Asian immigrants who have settled along the

                        that is as personal and it is generalizable, thereby providing an analytic view of a hitherto

                    <p>Pendular Borders challenges border-crossing dynamics through what I coin as a ‘binational
                        pendulum-like mobility’. Exploring the emotional, physical, and critical relationships that
                        emerge in the US-Mexico border is crucial to understanding the types of kinesthetic resistance
                        this geopolitical space produces. Pendular Borders will reveal through the practice of dance and
                        bodily movement the multiple identities and experiences lived by women who continuously traverse
                        the US-Mexico Border. This project will deliver 1) a dance performance; 2) a collection of
                        visual, performed and written testimonies made available on a website; 3) an article on the
                        community-based methodology developed for Pendular Borders, which will be part of the second
                        chapter of my dissertation. This work portrays the ways in which stories of immigrants are part
                        of the contemporary global history, and serves as an important example of how dance activates
                        change and invites participation across socio-economic, political, racial and cultural
                        backgrounds.</p>

                    <p>Migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees encounter profound challenges prior to leaving their home
                        country, during their journeys, and upon arrival at their destination. When traveling through
                        these spaces, they experience fear, uncertainty, despair, confusion, and other emotions. What
                        outlets are they afforded to express these emotions? Would creative expressions, for example,
                        through, poetry, creative writing, testimonios (testimonies/narratives), and pláticas (talks)
                        provide them with opportunities to name and narrate their worlds? Do artistic undertakings
                        create a healthier emotional and mental state for migrants and their loved ones? Can arts-based
                        experiences at least temporarily free individuals from pain or desperation? Although media
                        coverage of the “migrant experience” has been extensive, it has not often included the voices of
                        migrants themselves. These activities and testimonios will be explored in a virtual mode with

                    <p>After September 11th, 2001, the United States government set borders and unauthorized migration
                        as central themes to national security. Shortly thereafter, with the start of the war against
                        drugs in 2006 by the Mexican government and the onset of the Great Recession in 2007, the United
                        States strengthened measures to control unauthorized migration, violence at the Mexico-U.S.
                        border and the havoc caused by the recession. Consequences have included the increased budget
                        for the extension of the border wall and border surveillance; further restrictions for border
                        crossing that have fragmented border communities; and the implementation of stricter
                        anti-immigrant rhetoric and laws that criminalize clandestine border crossing and facilitate the
                        removal of unauthorized migrants. This project explores how local dynamics among residents,
                        organizations and authorities have been reconfigured since the beginning of the 2000s in Nogales
                        Sonora/Arizona borderlands. Through interviews with local and non-local organizations and
                        inhabitants, this work explores abrupt and gradual changes in local dynamics continuities and
                        terminations of local and binational projects, the increase in violence in the region, the
                        impact of growing in-transit migration, the initiatives that have arisen, and the participation
                        or not of the local and non-local populations. This work not only informs us on how the
                        reconfigurations in the Nogales Sonora/Arizona have affected the dynamics of the people living
                        and working in the region, but also contributes to conversations about how to support positive
                        responses to the current situation.</p>

                    <p>This&nbsp;project&nbsp;proposes to create an interdisciplinary research mechanism based on the
                        activation of dream audios as source material for exploration and interrogation. Through the
                        active listening and transcription of a dream archive, I have discovered the recurrent
                        description of scenes related to family archetypes, border community struggles, gender issues
                        and the persecution of necro-violent monsters. Through the dream archive research I will create
                        a visual and textual lexicon that serves as both a manual and methodological framework for
                        mapping an specific sensible political landscape: A US-Mexico Border region during the period of
                        2013 to 2020. This lexicon mapping practice aims to address the question of how we can translate
                        our dreams into material forms —texts, imaging, objects, in order to be able to speak and
                        discuss from a personal background about the manifestations of fears and desires that intersect
                        our sensible experience as subjects. The dream archive is based on my life experience as a young
                        woman who has lived her life on the US-Mexico border. Generating knowledge from the female
                        experience of the global south by applying a sensitive and intimate technique is an epistemic
                        decolonial effort.</p>

                        people from this border-zone through time. The videos will bring together musicians from both
                        sides of the border, and the songs will be sung in the two languages (Spanish and English) using
                        the words appropriate for each cultural identity. These videos will be edited so we can see
                        images from both countries and the singers and musicians in their own atmospheres and

                    <p>Integral to Fronteridades’ initiatives in its efforts to expand border learning, I plan to
                        incorporate inditas, a song genre that originated in Mexico resembling the corrido, into the
                        Spanish as a Heritage Language (SHL) classroom. This will contribute to an often-omitted history
                        of cross-border popular expressions between Mexico and New Mexico in the nineteenth century.
                        This study bridges interdisciplinary approaches of both archival and Spanish language recovery
                        to expand border learning in the SHL classroom. The study is twofold. One, it works to recover
                        the indita genre from the archives at the Center for Southwest Research at the University of New
                        Mexico (UNM) and the Gutiérrez-Hubbell Collection, both located in Albuquerque. The study will
                        re-historicize the cross-border connections between New Mexico and Mexico through the indita
                        genre and will contribute to borderlands scholarship with the creation of a manuscript for the
                        Journal of Arizona History. Secondly, the study will create a digital story for intermediate
                        heritage language students. This digital story will serve as a model for both recovery efforts
                        during a pandemic and as a model for students to create their own digital story focused on
                        borderlands oral traditions, popular culture and identity in the SHL classroom. I anticipate an
                        outcome of community-driven learning rooted in social justice in which students are able to
                        critically think about their own positionality in Arizona-Sonora cross-border dynamics through
                        oral traditions and popular performances.</p>

                        Heritage Language students, from Intermediate level courses, that reflect on their multicultural
                        and multilingual identities. One of the aims is to create an open resource in the form of a
                        website with these multimodal narratives. These narratives will be part of course assignments,
                        which until now, have followed a traditional essay style. Instead, for the purpose of this
                        research project, these assignments will be redesigned using a multimodal approach. A multimodal
                        narrative is a way of composing that does not privilege just the linguistic form. Using this
                        approach, students will have the opportunity to express their cultural and linguistic
                        diversities through multiple modes (texts, sounds, visuals, movements and gestures). The
                        multimodal nature of these narratives will have the potential to blossom multilingual ways of
                        creating meaning by students, which sometimes can be difficult to achieve through traditional
                        composing pedagogies. The process of developing their narratives, followed by the recognition
                        they will receive by being displayed to the public, will honor the students’ life experiences,
                        their family ties, their communities and culture.</p>

                        &nbsp;Testimonios will be gathered from women at the Kino Border Initiative's soup kitchen and
                        Casa Nazareth Women's Shelter in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico to explore how, when, and why migrant
                        women express their feminisms in contexts of migration and to gain a deeper understanding of
                        their migration-related knowledges. &nbsp;Borderlands feminisms are defined here as those daily
                        acts of expression of female consciousness, empowerment, agency, and opposition by women as they
                        cross and settle into the U.S. Mexico border region and anywhere they come into contact with the
                        dominant society. &nbsp;Marginalized knowledges are those unique ways of knowing of "female
                        brown bodies" that are often devalued and discounted because they are not considered
                        authoritative or objective knowledge. &nbsp;These "saberes" are based on the lived experiences
                        of women of color and embody their diverse ways of knowing and understanding the world.
                        &nbsp;Thematic analysis will be used to map, analyze, and interpret emerging themes and patterns
                        in the testimonio data.</p>

                    <p>The US / Mexico border location stirs up dominant stereotypes and false narratives of Mexican
                        immigrants and their drain on society. This project&nbsp;highlights six scholars from the border
                        town of San Luis to challenge this false majoritarian message. Using Solórzano &amp; Yosso’s
                        2001 definition of Counterstories as “a method of telling the stories of those people whose
                        experiences are not often told (p.32),” this project will highlight intimate, thought-provoking
                        individual experiences beginning with their junior high early college program to becoming
                        college graduates. Now, young professionals or graduate students their stories will advance
                        understanding of education as a means of social justice, especially for borderland,
                        first-generation and underrepresented students in higher education. Because images from
                        television, movies, and documentary film, rarely highlight underrepresented minorities as
                        valuable citizens and a foundation of strength to our country (Parker, 2012), this project will
                        create new ways of promoting the cultural wealth and resources that inspire and support academic
                        development. Logro Educativo Testimonios is a creative project that illuminates and honors the
                        voices of scholarly People of Color through storytelling performance.</p>

                    <p>Becky the Explorer addresses my personal experience with American history and popular culture to
                        explore the intersection of immigrant experience, family, and gender identity. The artwork
                        consists of video artworks and textile assemblages that layer my personal experience with
                        American history and popular culture to explore the intersection of immigration, family, and
                        gender identity. The assemblages are constructed from found and custom-printed fleece blankets,
                        and thrifted souvenirs. The blankets will bear images of pop culture icons, homeland heroes,
                        picturesque landscapes, religious figures, and sports stars that I collect and use as reference
                        material for my custom fleece prints. &nbsp;Similarly, the videos are edited into a montage of
                        Point-of-View (POV), landscapes, and performance sequences. &nbsp;By deconstructing and
                        reconfiguring those materials I create formal, physical and conceptual gaps where new meanings
                        are inferred and interpreted.</p>

                        art from around the globe. Housed in a repurposed firehouse in Downtown Tucson, MOCA Tucson
                        applies creative solutions to the problems of today and tomorrow through the vehicle of
                        contemporary art. We create programming that is ambitious, innovative, and that is responsive to
                        the wants and needs of our community. A pioneering museum of its kind in the community, MOCA
                        Tucson currently hosts rotating exhibitions by locally, nationally, and internationally renowned
                        contemporary artists—critical exhibitions that spur dialogue and that foster empathy between
                        artists and audiences. Our bold programming is highly engaging for diverse audiences and creates
                        a welcoming, inviting space for visitors to learn more about the changing world we live in. MOCA
                        Tucson is an important incubator and connector for contemporary art across the Southwest region

<h3>Project Lead: Bernadette Eguía, in partnership with collective members César López, Carolina Iniguez, and Javier Brambila</h3>
<p>This project employs a community based process of training and intervention in emotional and community health issues, with women living in Ambos Nogales. Collective members leading this effort previously developed and implemented this specific program with family members of migrants in Jalisco. Drawing from multiple perspectives, from public health to popular education and community organizing, this series of trainings aims to address the distinct individual and collective experiences that are influenced by living on the border, such as family separation. This 20-session training program will culminate in a community art/action project, to be designed by participants during the course of the program.</p>

<p>Paying homage to the history of Ambos Nogales as a busy tourist destination and cultural center, this project aims to bring life to the Ambos Nogales downtown area through a series of murals on both sides of the border, related to the city’s history. These murals will vary in techniques and styles, from graffiti to stencils, projections and free hand brush painting. The project will culminate in a community event, including a mural tour and street concert.</p>

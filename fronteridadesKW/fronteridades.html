                      O’odham Arts Exchange: The Place Where Clouds Are Formed
                  </h3>
                    <div class="card-text"><p>The O'odham Arts Exchange program supports artist and research exhibitions along with public programming enabling dialogue and reflection about how the U.S.-Mexico border has divided the ancestral lands of the Tohono O'odham people. It expands the "<a href="https://ccp.arizona.edu/events/3796-amai-mo-am-soson-g-cewagi-el-lugar-donde-se-forman-las-nubes-place-where-clouds-are" target="_blank">The Place Where Clouds Are Formed</a>" initiative.&nbsp;<a href="https://linguistics.arizona.edu/user/ofelia-zepeda" target="_blank">Ofelia Zepeda</a>, UArizona Regents' Professor and director of the American Indian Language Development Institute, photojournalist&nbsp;<a href="https://garethsmit.com/The-Place-Where-Clouds-are-Formed-copy" target="_blank">Gareth Smit</a>, and writer&nbsp;<a href="https://martinzicari.com/" target="_blank">Martín Zícari</a>&nbsp;led the program. The initiative disrupts "crisis" narratives of the border and replaces them with more accurate narratives about the lived experiences of borderland communities.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The O'odham Arts Exchange is a unique historic first step towards documenting the recovery and expansion of ties through shared culture and art of the O'odham in the U.S. and Mexico. The program includes the following:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The execution of a binational O'odham community artist grants and exhibitions program&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The collection of oral histories, film, photography, poetry, and research that documents Indigenous borderlands and challenges mainstream narratives, and&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The publication of a trilingual (English, Spanish, O'odham) document that combines artist collaborations and the core documentation project.&nbsp;</li>

                      Amplifying Blackness in the Borderlands
                  </h3>
                    <div class="card-text"><p>Amplifying Blackness in the Borderlands builds a network of partnerships and engagements clustered around formations and modes of Black and Brown (Afro-Latinx) community knowledges and creativity in the borderlands. The program supports the creation of two initiatives:&nbsp;</p>
    <h5>Borderlands Black Locals Community Film Collective</h5>
    <p>This initiative brings together Black and Afro-Latinx students in southern Arizona who share an interest in film. Local high school students, UArizona undergraduates, and Black youth, together with the Dunbar Pavilion, a local African American Arts and Cultural Center, establish their agendas related to film as a medium for storytelling and the amplification of Black experiences in the borderlands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <h5>Black Diaspora/Digital Collective</h5>
    <p>This initiative connects UArizona's Afro-Latinx and Black students with peers in similar geopolitical contexts. Students from UArizona's Gender Women Studies, the College of Fine Arts, and Africana Studies collaborate on creative, cross-cultural productions (e.g., short stories, zines, spoken word, playback theater, photography, short films/videos).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Amplifying Blackness in the Borderlands elevates Black voices, which are often overlooked in the borderlands but are critical to the history and contemporary understandings of 'place' (and experience) in the Southwest.</p>

                  </h3>
                    <div class="card-text"><p>Border Storytelling was a two-year program developed during the 2019-2021 Mellon Fronteridades project iteration.

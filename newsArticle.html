                <strong>Tucson, Ariz.</strong> - Over the summer, the <a href="https://confluencenter.arizona.edu/">Confluencenter for Creative Inquiry</a> and <a href="https://lib.arizona.edu/special-collections">University Libraries' Special Collections</a> selected three southern Arizona artists and scholars to creatively repurpose the Reclaiming the Border Narrative (RBN) archive. These recipients developed projects that use the RBN digital archive materials in innovative and compelling ways.

                Each artist brought their own personal touch to the project and created displays for community members to engage with. The projects celebrated the archive’s impact through new perspective to the border narrative and recognized the rich content it preserves.

                Yeh is a chef and emerging multidisciplinary food artist in the Tucson community. She created a Chinese Grocery Store Pop-Up at the Tucson Museum of Art. Shelves filled and stocked with goods labeled with titles from the Reclaiming the Border Narrative Digital Archive and historic photos of Chinese grocery stores. “The installation will create a space for reflection on history, community, and identity as well as give opportunity to contribute to the borderland narrative.” &nbsp;

                Yeh’s project is a nod to the 100 or more forgotten centers for community that existed in the barrios of downtown Tucson, Arizona. Placing the archive within the grocery store as a historic cradle for the complexity and interconnected resilience of borderland identity.&nbsp;

                    “The pop-up will prepare our community to begin a dialog exploring their own relation to the borderlands. How has their connection to forced displacement and historical erasure affected their perception of time, place and people? How does this kind of dynamic storytelling act as collective resistance?”

                The <a href="https://bordernarrative.lib.arizona.edu/">Reclaiming the Border Narrative digital archive</a> houses materials created by dozens of borderlands journalists, activists, culture bearers, storytellers and artists who challenge dominant and mainstream narratives that portray the borderlands in a negative light and criminalize migration. The archive is supported and maintained by Special Collections at the University Libraries.&nbsp;
